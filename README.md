# Hi, I'm Ashley

I’m an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science (AI Track). I am a first-generation Latina and transfer student transitioning from a finance background into software engineering and technology.

Currently, I am:
- Learning Python and strengthening my CS fundamentals (CS106A)
- Building personal projects focused on finance and data (such as an expense emotion tracker and image processing projects)
- Exploring roles in software engineering, AI, and fintech

Previous experience includes working as an Alternative Investments Summer Analyst at Wafra through the Girls Who Invest program. I am passionate about advancing equity in technology and supporting other transfer and first-generation students.

My goals for 2026 are to:
- Continue progressing through the CS AI track and deepen my technical skills
- Apply to software engineering fellowship programs (including those at JPMorgan and Jane Street)
- Develop impactful technical projects that support underserved communities

Interests: artificial intelligence, fintech, algorithms, data analysis, and problem solving through technology
